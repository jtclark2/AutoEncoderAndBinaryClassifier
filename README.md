# AnomalyDetectorAndMore
Anomaly Detector that I put together for weld applications, and some extra projects for fun.

I'm keeping this a bit light because the notebooks contain most the description.

### Why did I cluster these projects together?
I wrote them at the same time, and seem to have jupyter notebooks sitting around in various places. I may split them out later, but wanted to get them in a repo, so I atleast start tracking properly.

# Setup
TBD - basically open jupyter notebook, and navigate to the file
> `jupyter notebook`

### BinaryClassifier
- I've recently tested the classifier, so I know it works (though you may )
- Update `root_dir` path to the data (which is too big for the repo)

### AnomalyDetector
- Should work (definitely used to, assuming I snagged the most recent copy, but haven't tested since I first wrote it)


# Run
Just like any notebook
